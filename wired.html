      <h3>What is a Wired Network?</h3>
      <p>A wired network is a system where devices are physically connected via cables — like veins channeling lifeblood between machines. These networks are renowned for their reliability, speed, and resistance to external interference.</p>
      <p>Data travels through Ethernet cables (often twisted pair or fiber optics), connecting computers, servers, and printers to a centralized switch or router. It's the traditional method — old-school, grounded, and powerful.</p>

      <h3>Hardware Needed</h3>
      <p>To set up a wired network, you'll need specific components — the ritual tools of the networking underworld:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Router:</strong> Connects the local network to the internet — the gatekeeper.</li>
        <li><strong>Switch:</strong> Directs traffic within the network like a crypt warden.</li>
        <li><strong>Ethernet Cables:</strong> Typically Cat5e or Cat6 — the lifelines of data.</li>
        <li><strong>Network Interface Card (NIC):</strong> Installed in each device, allowing it to connect physically.</li>
        <li><strong>Patch Panel (optional):</strong> Keeps things organized in large setups — your cabling altar.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Pros & Cons of Wired Networking</h3>
      <p>All power comes at a cost. Wired networking offers many strengths but also bears its burdens:</p>

      <h4>🖤 Pros:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Wired networks typically offer faster data transfer rates than wireless (up to 10 Gbps or more).</li>
        <li><strong>Stability:</strong> No interference from walls, microwaves, or other ghosts in the air.</li>
        <li><strong>Security:</strong> Physical connections are harder to intercept than wireless signals — good for keeping secrets buried.</li>
        <li><strong>Low Latency:</strong> Perfect for gaming, streaming, and time-critical tasks like online necromancy.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>💀 Cons:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Limited Mobility:</strong> Devices are tethered — a chain that binds you to one place.</li>
        <li><strong>Complex Setup:</strong> Requires planning, routing cables, and sometimes drilling through castle walls.</li>
        <li><strong>Clutter:</strong> Too many wires can summon the Cable Demon (or at least a messy workspace).</li>
        <li><strong>Cost:</strong> Especially in large buildings — installing cables can drain your coin pouch.</li>
      </ul>
